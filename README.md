# Popular Movies - Android App

This is my Popular Movies App. Wich I have been developing as part of [Udacity's Android Nanodegree Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

### To compile this app you will need to: 
1. Create an API KEY on [The Movie DB's website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
2. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/csilva2810/popular-movies.git`
3. Create a **build.properties** file inside your [home-directory]/.gradle/ with the folowing content: `MyTmdbApiKey="{here_goes_your_api_key}"`
