# Popular Movies - Android App

This is my Popular Movies App. Wich I have been developing as part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree course.

To compile this app you will need to create an API KEY on https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api.
Then you will have to create a build.properties file in the project root directory with the folowing content:

MyTmdbApiKey="{here_comes_your_api_key}"
